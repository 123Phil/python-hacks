============

A collection of fun scripts I wrote in my spare time

The salesman one solves the travelling salesman problem with the shortest neighbor method...
I was doing some optimization algorithm stuff, but never got around to implementing a full-fledged solution.

tabber.py is probably the most useful script here - I wrote it to fix spaces into tabs since python needs uniformity.

the morse script has a dictionary with alphabet to morse translations

the pascal script has the functions needed to calculate numbers in pascal's triangle, which might come in handy when you least expect.
